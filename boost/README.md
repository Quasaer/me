# Boost 2021
## Week 1
1. Basic Setup with me repo that will be used to contain a knowledge base for zettlekasten notes and also boost notes. The overall structure of this repo should stick with single level lists i.e. one readme per folder. The folder name should be unique to identify such as using an isosec (YYYYMMDDHHIISS). Other folders can be used for longner form of note taking. Zet notes need to be short and it is discouraged to use headers in notes.
1. Setup a VM with Ubuntu server because it is very popular in the enterprise space.
